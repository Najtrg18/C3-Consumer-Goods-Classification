# Project Overview
[Project Overview](https://github.com/Najtrg18/C3-Consumer-Goods-Classification/blob/main/C3_%20presentation.pdf)

# Data 
Sourced from: OpenClassRooms

# Objective 
Study the feasibility of a classification engine to help automatically categorise the products for sale

# Constraints
- Use one of the following algos : SIFT / ORB / SURF => ORB was used
- Use of 2 “bag-of-words” approaches - CV and TF-IDF
- Use of Word2Vec, BERT and USE
- Use of CNN Transfer Learning

# Competencies
- Pre-processing textual data : NLTK, Spacy, CV, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT, USE
- Pre-processing visual data : OpenCV, ORB, CNN (Keras), CNN VGG16
- Dimensions Reduction : PCA, TSNE
- Modeling : Clustering (Kmeans), Supervised classification (KNN)
- Evaluation : ARI, Accuracy
